# Flutter_Development
Let's learn and explore flutter from scratch.

The examples are provided in the different branches of this repository. To see the code for a particluar Widget or any other example, choose the appropriate branch.
E.g. to see the code for Container Class Example, checkout the container_properties branch. 

**Important** - If you are cloning the repo to your desktop, you will need to perform a packages get / pub get to install any dependencies that the project may have at that point of the course.
